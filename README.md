# Bitcoin_perception
A study on how Bitcoin is perceived by no-coiners (non-holders of Bitcoin).

#Context
- How no-coiners perceive Bitcoin is a key determining factor to Bitcoin's adoption. Understanding how they perceive (and misperceive) it can be invaluable to address blockers to adoption and drive more usage. 
- Listening to no-coiners is a first step to understanding their beliefs and motivations to not buying bitcoin.

#Aims & objectives
- This research aims to gain a better picture of the beliefs of no-coiners about Bitcoin. Understanding these beliefs can help point to their behaviours, their non-action when buying Bitcoin. The objective is to gain a comprehensive list of these beliefs surrounding Bitcoin.

#Approach & Methodology
- To gain enough insight into the motivations a structured open-ended survey will be employed. Multiple-choices will be used to ensure the appropriate audiences are reached. The no-coiners we intend to reach are:
  - people who have heard about bitcoin
  - people who may or may not know what bitcoin is (even people who may not know may have some been fed certain perspectives about it)
  - people who have never bought or received bitcoin
- Utilising an online Google Form survey can allow us to share the survey across different channels, whereby Bitcoiners can send the survey to ther no-coiner friends and families and thereby increase the reach of the survey. To enable the survey results to be shared in an open-source fashion, we don't intend to ask any personal/confidential information in this survey.

#Limitations
- Online survey results may not always elicit high quality responses from the responders, so we will ensure only the essential questions are asked. 
- Online surveys may also elicit superficial responses, and more in-depth qualitative research may be require to do further probing in some areas.
- No-coiners may simply not be interested in Bitcoin and their responses may not reveal a great degree of thought because they may never have put much thought into this topic. This needs to be considered. In fact, the results will be revealing of a lot of 'misperceptions' and 'misunderstandings' concerning Bitcoin.
